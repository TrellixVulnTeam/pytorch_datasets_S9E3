# PyTorch Datasets

I create some unavailable pytorch datasets that I will try to push into the torchvision package.

## Compatibility

  These datasets are preparared for at least torchvision 0.2.2 and require scipy version 1.2.1. They have been programmed 
  reusing code and following the same structure as other provided datasets. Basically, fucntions that appear in orchvision 0.3.0
  but not in torchvision 0.2.2 has been directly copied into the file so as to be able to easily incorporate in the main project.
